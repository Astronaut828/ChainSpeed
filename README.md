## 🎯 What is ChainSpeed?

ChainSpeed is a real-time blockchain analytics tool that measures and compares the performance of different blockchain networks. It provides instant feedback on network response times by monitoring WETH balance checks across multiple chains simultaneously.

### 🔍 Supported Networks:

-   Ethereum 🌐
-   Base 🟢
-   Arbitrum 🔵
-   Optimism 🔴
-   Polygon 💜
-   BNB Chain 💛
-   Avalanche ❄️
-   Fantom 👻

## 🚀 Features

-   **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live response time tracking for all supported networks
-   **Performance Comparison**: Easy-to-read comparative analysis between different chains
-   **Historical Tracking**: Rolling averages of the last 10 calls for each network
-   **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices

## 📊 How It Works

ChainSpeed performs continuous balance checks on WETH contracts across different networks and measures:

1. Response time for each request
2. Success/failure rate of calls
3. Rolling average performance metrics
4. Network reliability indicators

## 🔮 Coming Soon

-   **Write Call Analysis**: Testing network performance for transaction submissions
-   **Gas Cost Comparison**: Real-time gas fee analysis across networks
-   **Extended Network Support**: Adding more blockchain networks
-   **Custom Contract Testing**: Ability to test specific smart contract interactions
